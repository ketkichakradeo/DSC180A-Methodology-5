**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic this quarter has been learning what neutrinos are and how to detect their waveforms. I had no prior knowledge of physics coming into this domain and thus I am really glad to be learning so many new things each week. I really enjoyed getting to examine the raw energy and tail slope parameters in detail as well.
**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I'd like to investigate 
**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
A potential change for my Quarter 1 project would be to implement 
**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I would be interested in exploring
