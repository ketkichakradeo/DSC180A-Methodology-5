**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic this quarter has been learning what neutrinos are and how to detect their waveforms. I had no prior knowledge of physics coming into this domain and thus I am really glad to be learning so many new things each week. I really enjoyed getting to examine the raw energy and tail slope parameters in detail as well.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I'd like to investigate directionality of the waveform based on the data we have. Ultimately studying neutrinos could help us learn more about the universe and the history behind many astro-physical events. Studying the direction of waveforms could potentially show us the origin of other astrophysical events. We would have to obtain directional data to complete this investigation.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
A potential change for my Quarter 1 project would be to implement Permutation Feature Importance using the scikit learn package. We are working with over 10 parameters and thus might help us to determine which parameters are more important than others for our model. While having a lot of parameters is good, too many might lower the efficiency of the model. This will help us filter out parameters that aren't needed.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I would be interested in exploring more ways to model the waveforms. Right now we are just plotting parameters on an x and y axis but I would want to maybe add another dimension and try to create an interactive 3d model of sorts.
